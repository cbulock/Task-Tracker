# Task-Tracker
Tool for tracking chores and house maintenance 

A quickly thrown together tool used to track chores that need to be done. Code needs a major refactor.

The general idea behind this is, on the /add page, you can add chores to be done and set a timeframe for how often they need to be completed.

If a chore is done, if can be marked completed and will no longer show, until the time frame it should be available to do again.
